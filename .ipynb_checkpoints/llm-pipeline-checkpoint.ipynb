      "\n",
      "1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX): Vertex has a strong track record of developing and commercializing innovative drugs for rare and underserved diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. The company's pipeline is also promising, with multiple new product launches planned before the end of the decade. Its strong balance sheet and market leadership in cystic fibrosis therapies provide a solid foundation for long-term growth.\n",
      "2. Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY): Bristol Myers has a diversified portfolio of pharmaceutical products, including cancer drugs, and is investing in new medicines with potential blockbuster status. The company's recent patent cliffs are a concern, but it has a plan to address these issues and is developing a subcutaneous version of its Opdivo drug to expand its indications. Bristol Myers' dividend program is also attractive, with a forward yield of 5.46%.\n",
      "3. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE): While Pfizer's top line is currently declining due to the pandemic, the company's investment in COVID-19 products has paid off, and it has launched several new products in recent years. Pfizer's pipeline is also promising, with multiple potential blockbusters in development. The company's strong balance sheet and history of acquisitions and investments provide a solid foundation for long-term growth.\n",
