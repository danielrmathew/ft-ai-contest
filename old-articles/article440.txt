In this article, we will look at the 5 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy.The United States of America, China, and Germany are some of the most powerful countries in the world by economy. Factors including strong GDP growth, low inflation rates, increased employment opportunities, and strong investment determine a country’s economic power. In addition to these factors, the overall world economic outlook also contributes to the economic performance of these countries. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) April 2024 update, the world economy grew at 3.2% in 2023 and is forecasted to continue growing at the same rate in 2024 and 2025. The advanced economies of the world are expected to witness a slight increase in growth rate and are forecasted to grow at 1.7% in 2024 as compared to a 1.6% growth rate in 2023. On the other hand, growth for emerging and developing economies is expected to slow down modestly from 4.3% in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024.Global headline inflation is easing and was close to the pre-pandemic level in late 2023 for most economies. During the last quarter of 2023, headline inflation was recorded to be 2.3% down from 9.5% in the second quarter of 2022 in a quarter-wise analysis. While headline inflation for emerging and developing countries has also cooled down from its peak of 13.7% in the first quarter of 2022, it is still considerably high and was recorded at 9.9% in the last quarter of 2023. The mean inflation rate for developing countries is high due to uncontrolled inflation in some countries. For instance, on May 3rd, Reuters reported that annual consumer price inflation in Turkey climbed up by 69.8% in April, the rise was still below expectations, however, it was the highest since late 2022. The Finance Minister of Turkey, Mehmet Simsek, said that though inflation will peak in May, it will start to ease sharply to be in line with the government's prediction.
