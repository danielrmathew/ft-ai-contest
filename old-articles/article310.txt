In this article, we list and discuss the 30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the top 6 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US.Quality education undoubtedly sets a person up for success. According to a Fortune500 report, 75% of the world's top 20 CEOs held an MBA or other graduate degree in 2023, 100% of the top 20 held an undergraduate degree, and 11.8% of the top 100 CEOs in the world in 2023 attended undergrad programs from IVY institutes. For context, the IVY League is a group of  8 private universities in the US, renowned worldwide for their history, academic excellence, and exclusivity. It's also interesting to note that although all eight of these institutions are classified among the most prestigious colleges in the world, they do not typically define quality.The quality and worth of an institution can be judged through different metrics like alumni salary, graduation and retention rates, net costs, academic success, etc. However, a low acceptance rate – or exclusivity – does not directly equate to quality. At the same time, the acceptance rate and the measure of quality or economic value of a college are closely linked. That’s because the hardest colleges academically to get into often excel in all the quality metrics and provide a better ROI than inclusive universities.For example, the #1 college in the US by worth is extremely selective, and fresh graduates from this institute can make approximately over $110,000. In comparison, a graduate from any American university with a 100% acceptance rate would make less than half of the same amount. In fact, graduates from top colleges dominated the list of highest-paying bachelor’s degrees as of 2023. Put simply, some of the best colleges in the US which produce the most highly-qualified graduates have high competition and low acceptance rates. Therefore, although exclusivity is not a direct measure of an institute's economic value for students, it is an indirect one.In the US, there is a wide variety of colleges in terms of inclusivity. Some colleges allow everyone to get in, others accept in moderation, and some tend to be extremely selective. Similar to acceptance rate diversity, tuition fees also vary depending on the exclusivity and inclusivity of a college (See: 15 Cheapest American Universities with Low Tuition for International Students).Generally, though, college tuition is costly in the US, with most students having to spend years after graduating trying to pay off their debts. With an average annual tuition fee of $27,091, the US has the highest cost of education in the world. According to the Federal Reserve report, student debt was over $1.7 trillion by the end of 2023. Compared to 2022, this is a decrease of $36.9 billion. However, compared to 2019, the debt grew by $89.3 billion at the end of 2023.The high student debt is a result of the high cost of education in the US, which in turn, affects the accessibility of quality higher education to many individuals in the US. For this reason, some multinational companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), and Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) are making an effort to help their employees pay for college through tuition reimbursement.Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has committed to invest a total of $1.2 billion by 2025 in its Career Choice, which is an employees' education and skills training benefits program. In this program, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers funding for college tuition, high school diplomas, GEDs, and English as a Second Language (ESL) proficiency certifications for more than 750,000 front-line employees in the US. Through its Career Choice program, the company aims to support its employees in getting over the biggest barriers to education – time and money.Meanwhile, Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), an American multinational insurance company, offers to cover up to $5,250 in pre-approved education expenses per calendar year as tuition assistance for its employees. The coverage includes tuition, course fees, textbooks, registration fees, lab fees, and any cost related to the job or career path-related course. Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) also offers tuition-free professional certificate and boot camp programs through its Guild Education plan.On the other hand, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX), an American multinational healthcare corporation, supports education by offering scholarships for undergraduate studies. The scholarships are on a merit basis and only available for children of Baxter International Inc.’s (NYSE:BAX) employees.Below, we list the top hardest colleges to get into in the US.30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the USFor the list of the 30 Hardest Colleges to Get Into in the US, we used the College Navigator by the National Center of Education Statistics to browse through their directory of 7,000 colleges and universities in the United States and shortlist a pool of the top 42 colleges with less than 15% acceptance rates.We then obtained the acceptance rates and number of undergraduate applicants for each college, and assigned weights to both these metrics. A weight of 30% was assigned to the acceptance rate as this demonstrates exclusivity and a weight of 70% was assigned to the number of applicants as this demonstrates competition. Once we had assigned weights, we normalized our data to ensure that both metrics contributed equally to our final ranking, and then calculated the composite score. Our final metric represented the exclusivity of each college. For the final step, we ranked the colleges based on this metric. The list is ranked in ascending order, going up to the hardest college to get into in the US. Note that the data we have used is as recent as the one provided by NCES (Fall 2022).By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.
