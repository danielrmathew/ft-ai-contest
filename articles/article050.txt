That’s just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher.”The news comes after Musk and Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization last week with the executive saying on X that the network will grow at “a slower pace” for new locations.Yahoo Finance's senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian reports:Automakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network, and incorporate Tesla’s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.Tesla was likely getting an earful from its NACS partners, questioning what they were getting exactly after signing deals to access the Supercharger network.In addition, contractors and others working with Tesla on existing Supercharger projects were getting their emails bounced back with no feedback on what to do next. Tesla also apparently backed out of leases at four upcoming Supercharger sites in New York, per EV blog Electrek.Charging network provider EVgo told Yahoo Finance that it was “actively engaged” in the development of the NACS network and was adding more locations to take advantage of Tesla’s move to backtrack its expansion.EVgo competitor Blink Charging is also poised to move on the opportunity, claiming potential Supercharger customers contacted Blink about future orders in the wake of Tesla’s move.Even oil and gas stalwarts like BP are moving in on Tesla.

In recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective."US-listed Chinese electric vehicle makers like Nio (NIO), Li Auto (LI), and Xpeng (XPEV) saw shares drop on Friday following news that President Biden is set to unveil tariffs on China strategic industries, including EVs, batteries and solar cells.Existing tariffs will be maintained with an announcement expected to come as soon as next week, according to Bloomberg.A separate report from the Wall Street Journal said the administration plans to "roughly quadruple" the levy.The development comes ahead of a critical election year with China's economic strength in focus.Biden said last month he would impose 25% tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum. Trump has vowed to hit Beijing with a 60% levy on all Chinese imports if he were to be reelected.“Instead of correcting its wrong practices, the United States continued to politicize economic and trade issues,” Lin Jian, a ministry spokesman, said on Friday. “To further increase tariffs is to add insult to injury.”US stocks lost steam in early afternoon trading on Friday after consumer sentiment hit a six-month low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which is eyeing its eighth straight win, clung to gains of roughly 0.1%, with the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hovering above the flatline on the heels of closing above 5,200 for the first time in a month.
