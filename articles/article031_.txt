BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski boosted his year-end price target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to 5,600 from 5,100 in a research note on Wednesday, noting that momentum in the market is "likely to persist." Belski's 5,600 target reflects about 7% upside from Monday's close."We are comfortable with this because we believe the market is behaving in a similar fashion to 2021 and 2023 – years where we did not give enough credit to the strength of market momentum, something we are trying to avoid this time around," Belski wrote in a research note.Belski is the latest in a string of Wall Street strategists to chase the 2024 stock market rally higher with a boosted year-end target. The high-water mark on the Street entering the year was 5,200, with the median strategist target projecting the benchmark average to end the year at 4,850.But as earnings have grown more than expected and US economic growth has largely surprised to the upside, 10 of the 15 strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance are now at or above 5,200 on the year-end targets.Netflix (NFLX) has won the streaming rights to two National Football League (NFL) games set to air Christmas Day, the company announced in a post on X Wednesday morning.It's a surprising development given the streaming giant has previously said it wanted to avoid investing in live sports content.The doubleheader matchups will be announced once the NFL releases its full schedule Wednesday evening. The company will reportedly pay less than $150 million per game, according to Bloomberg.In addition to this year's games, the company also revealed it will be streaming at least one holiday game per year as part of a three-season deal."Last year, we decided to take a big bet on live — tapping into massive fandoms across comedy, reality TV, sports, and more," Netflix Chief Content Officer, Bela Bajaria said in a news release. "There are no live annual events, sports or otherwise, that compare with the audiences NFL football attracts. We’re so excited that the NFL’s Christmas Day games will be only on Netflix."Netflix had previously maintained that it wants to focus on "sports entertainment" instead of paying for the rights to live sports, which can be expensive for media companies. In the past, the company has released docuseries and sports-adjacent content like "The Quarterback," "Formula 1: Drive to Survive," "Full Swing," and "Break Point," in addition to live sporting events like the "Netflix Cup" celebrity golf tournament, which aired late last year.One recently announced partnership seemed to deviate from that status quo. In January, Netflix announced a 10-year deal with TKO Group Holding's WWE (TKO) that will bring WWE’s flagship program Raw, a live wrestling production, to the streaming service beginning in 2025.But at the time, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the inclusion of the program did not signal a change in its overall sports strategy, describing the deal as "unique" compared to the global sports rights of professional leagues like the NBA or UFC.Wall Street analysts and industry watchers have long predicted Netflix will eventually be forced to go all-in on sports, describing live sports as the last frontier of streaming amid a deteriorating cable bundle.Read more here.GameStop shares (GME) tanked more than 25% Wednesday as a rally among meme related stocks appears to be unwinding.GameStop stock gained more than 180% in the prior two sessions, amid a massive short squeeze following the reemergence of Keith Gill, also known as "Roaring Kitty," whose bull case on GameStop ignited the meme stock rally back in 2021.AMC (AMC) shares also fell about 20% Wednesday after the theater chain operator rose 95% over the last two days. Other heavily shorted stocks which fell Wednesday included SunPower (SPWR), down 29%.

Both measures met economist expectations.As we witness GameStop (GME) up another 8% premarket, it's worth noting that wild bubble moves like this aren't spreading throughout the broader market.That could be captured in this nifty new valuation chart from Goldman Sachs this morning.
