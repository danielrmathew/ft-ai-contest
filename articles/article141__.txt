The IMF has urged ministers to raid inheritances and charge drivers for using the roads in a bid to find the cash to increase spending, even as drivers buy electric cars and, therefore, stop paying tax on petrol and diesel.Jeremy Hunt has not budgeted enough money for health, social care or net zero, the global financial watchdog has warned.But the national debt is also rising, so extra spending has to be funded by tax rises instead of more borrowing, it said.The Chancellor’s plans “do not appear to sufficiently account for known pressures in public services (especially health and social care), and critical growth-enhancing investment needs (including for the green transition),” the IMF said in its review of Britain’s economy and finances.Raising taxes by another 1pc of GDP would help raise spending while stabilising debt, it said.“This could be achieved, for example, by raising additional revenue from higher carbon and road-usage taxation, broadening the VAT and inheritance tax bases, and reforming capital gains and property taxation (which could also allow a reduction in stamp duty),” the IMF said.Road-usage taxation indicates fuel duty, which is fading as drivers go electric, could be replaced by road pricing - which could mean a system of monitoring drivers’ journeys to charge them based on the distance they travel, and potentially increasing costs for those who drive at peak times.Read the latest updates below.Thanks for joining us today.We’ll be back in the morning but I’ll leave you with news that nearly seven months after a £100m Government scheme to support Welsh steel workers was created, none of the money provided has been spent.The animated film studio behind Toy Story is to lay off 14pc of its workforce after suffering a string of flops, including Elemental and Lightyear.Pixar will lose 175 staff as Disney, its parent company, scales back spending. Pixar will stop producing series for the Disney+ streaming service to focus on films.James Warrington explains:It comes amid wider cost-cutting under chief executive Bob Iger, who has cut thousands of jobs as part of a plan to strip out $7.5bn of costs.Mr Iger, who returned to Disney in late 2022, has set out plans to cut spending on new films and TV shows amid concerns the media giant has focused too much on quality over quantity.Earlier this month, Disney will cut production from its Marvel division, which owns franchises including Avengers and Iron Man, after a spate of flops.Pixar, which is behind hits such as Toy Story and The Incredibles, has also struggled since the pandemic.Elemental delivered one of the studio’s worst ever openings when it was released last summer, though it has since made around $500m at the box office.Still, the disappointing release has forced executives at Pixar to rethink the company’s release strategy, especially given the high production costs in animation.Bosses are now pinning their hopes on Inside Out 2, which is due to be released next month, as well as its first ever original series Win or Lose, which is expected on Disney+ later this year.Eurostar passengers at St Pancras station will be forced to negotiate a five-step check-in process under strict new EU rules, providing their fingerprints and a mugshot twice and answering a series of questions on the nature of their trip. Christopher Jasper reports:People planning to travel through the Channel Tunnel will be sent a guide to the new system as soon as they book, including a flow chart and checklist detailing each stage of the process and explaining why it is being implemented.Eurostar has spent €10m (£8.5m) on dozens of new border kiosks, which it said on Tuesday will keep passengers moving once the so-called Entry/Exit System (EES) is finally introduced on October 6.Brussels says the EES, which will replace the physical stamping of passports, is aimed at enhancing border security. It will harvest data on EU entries and exits, calculate the number of times people cross the border, and record overstayers and refusals of entry.Read the full story...The main US indexes oscillated within a tight range this afternoon as investors grew cautious ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia’s earnings this week and Federal Reserve officials emphasized the central bank was in no hurry to ease interest rates.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite index are up 0.06pc, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.03pc.Nvidia, Wall Street’s third-most valuable firm, will report quarterly earnings on Wednesday in what is likely to be a significant market trigger and a litmus test for the success of the generative AI boom.Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, said:For investors to drive Nvidia shares even higher, they’re going to be looking for some very aggressive forward numbers that keeps them feeling that the stock could continue on its upward climb.Investors also awaited minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting, due on Wednesday, with two rate-setters on Tuesday saying it was prudent to wait several more months to ensure inflation really is back on a path to the 2pc target before commencing rate cuts.The Footsie - along with major continental markets - fell today.

Industry editor Matt Oliver reports:Stellantis said it would stop putting green, white and red stripes on its Fiat 600 SUVs to prevent misunderstandings about where they are assembled.It is the latest concession by the company amid a simmering row with Ms Meloni’s administration over how its cars are presented to consumers.Last month Stellantis announced it would rename Alfa Romeo’s Milano SUV, which is also produced in Poland, after ministers in Rome claimed the “Italian-sounding” moniker was misleading.Read the full story...A group of Tesla investors is pushing to oust Elon Musk’s brother from the electric carmaker’s board as a row rages over the chief executive’s $56bn (£44bn) pay deal. Matt Oliver reports:The coalition of investors, which between them hold a small share of stock, claims that Kimbal Musk and fellow director James Murdoch are both incapable of scrutinising Elon properly because of their personal links to the billionaire.The complaint comes as the group of Tesla shareholders are also urging other investors to reject a $56bn pay package for Elon, which was overturned by a court in January and is now being proposed again by Tesla’s board.The group of rebel shareholders are Amalgamated Bank, AkademikerPension, Nordea Asset Management, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, Share, SOC Investment Group, Unison and United Church Funds.In a letter to fellow Tesla investors, they said the company was suffering from “a material governance failure” and warned: “The board is stacked with directors that have close personal ties to Elon Musk ...“Kimbal is Musk’s brother and has been on the board for 20 years, and James Murdoch is a longtime personal friend of the chief executive.”Elon’s pay package was originally backed by shareholders in 2018 and handed the chief executive massive stock awards if he hit certain targets linked to Tesla’s market capitalisation, sales and profits.The billionaire successfully met those conditions but the package was still overturned by a judge in Delaware amid concerns it wasn’t in the best interest of shareholders.Now, Tesla’s board is putting the pay package to a shareholder vote for a second time to prove it has their backing at the company’s annual general meeting.Ask most people what they associate with Milton Keynes and they are likely to mention roundabouts, concrete cow sculptures and the fractious move of Wimbledon FC to the town in the early 2000s.To Angela Rayner, however, Milton Keynes offers a blueprint for the future. Melissa Lawford reports:In a speech on Tuesday, Labour’s deputy leader laid out plans to build a new generation of Milton Keynes-style “new towns” to ease the housing crisis and boost the economy.“Labour’s towns of the future” will feature green spaces and good transport links, and 40pc of homes will be classed as affordable, Rayner promised.“We can turbo-charge growth to the benefit of working people across Britain,” she said.In seeking a plan for the future, Rayner was reaching into the past. Milton Keynes was conceived by Harold Wilson’s Labour government as part of the third wave of new towns built to alleviate housing shortages in the wake of the Second World War.Read the full story to find out why Labour’s plans could be hamstrung by its own policies...The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell in early trading this afternoon as investors grew cautious ahead of AI chip leader Nvidia’s earnings this week and Federal Reserve officials emphasised the central bank is in no hurry to ease interest rates.Nvidia shares initially fell 1.3pc ahead of its quarterly earnings announcement on Wednesday that is likely to be a significant market trigger and a litmus test for the success of the generative AI boom.Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, warned that investor expectations of Nvidia are really high. She said:The market is expecting another monster [earnings] report ...Analysts are bullish ahead of this earnings report, and they have upgraded their forecasts for Nvidia’s revenues, earnings per share, net income and Ebitda [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] in the last 4 weeks.This might mean that Nvidia will need to exceed already high expectations to sustain the rally in its share price.Some estimate that Nvidia revenues will need to exceed expectations by $1bn to appease the market. If Nvidia can exceed elevated expectations, then the stock price may rally further, however, the bar is high ahead of these results.Nestle is launching a new range of protein-enriched pastas and pizzas for people taking weight-loss drugs, amid fears treatments like Wegovy will hammer sales. Hannah Boland reports:The food maker, whose brands include KitKat, Haagen-Dazs and Nescafe, has created a new line of products to give people taking anti-obesity treatments “the right nutrition - high protein, good fibre, the right minerals”.The range, which will launch in the US later this year, is expected to include frozen pizzas, toasted sandwiches and pizza bowls, Reuters reported.Nestle bosses said the products have been developed specifically for people on GLP-1 drugs, such as Wegovy and Ozempic, a diabetes treatment which is used off-label to treat obesity.Morgan Stanley found that patients taking the treatments cut back significantly on both alcoholic and sugary non-alcoholic drinks, with consumption falling by 63pc and 65pc respectively.It has sparked fears among investors that food companies could see their sales suffer significantly.America’s biggest supermarket Walmart said last year it had seen a “slight pullback” in how much people were putting in their baskets, blaming the dip on more people taking obesity drugs.Nestle said last year that it expected the emergence of weight-loss injections to hurt its sales.Chief executive Mark Schneider said: “In our case, that will be the frozen food side of things, confectionary, and to some extent ice cream.”Progress in the US Federal Reserve’s fight against inflation “likely resumed” last month, a senior bank official said Tuesday, adding that additional rate hikes were probably unnecessary.Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said:The inflation data for April suggests that progress toward [the target of] two percent has likely resumed ...One month does not constitute a trend, but this data suggests that policy is doing its job to moderate aggregate demand, which will support renewed progress in lowering inflation.Central bankers should never say never, but the data suggests that inflation isn’t accelerating, and I believe that further increases in the policy rate are probably unnecessary.On Monday, another member of the bank’s rate-setting committee, Michael Barr, said that recent data had not given him the “increased confidence” he needed to support easing monetary policy.But Mr Waller sounded a more optimistic note Tuesday, but with some notable caveats. He said:While the April inflation data represents progress, the amount of progress was small ...The economy now seems to be evolving closer to what the committee expected.Nevertheless, in the absence of a significant weakening in the labor market, I need to see several more months of good inflation data before I would be comfortable supporting an easing in the stance of monetary policy.More than a fifth of shareholder votes were cast against Shell’s climate strategy at a tense annual general meeting.The board faced heated exchanges with investors and protesters throughout the three-hour event in London today.A resolution to approve the current strategy saw 21.8pc of shareholder votes going against management, Shell said.Meanwhile, nearly a fifth of the votes (18.6pc) backed a resolution from Dutch activist group Follow This, which called on the board to align decarbonisation targets with the goals of the Paris climate agreement.But despite a record 27 institutional investors co-filing the resolution, the result came as a drop from 20.2pc in 2023.The AGM was the first since Shell scaled back several short-term and medium-term climate targets last year.Chairman Sir Andrew Mackenzie’s defended the company’s stance on the climate, emphasising the goal to be net zero by 2050 and explaining how it believes the energy system will transition in the decades ahead.The chairman argued Shell believes the world will need more liquefied natural gas (LNG) through the transition and that “oil will play a vital role for a long way to come”.He added: “While it might be tempting to stop using oil and gas before the world is ready, we must not do so at the expense of the energy needs and aspirations of a growing global population.”A British dressmaker favoured by the Princess of Wales is shutting down after a “dramatic” hit from upheaval in the luxury fashion market.Our retail editor Hannah Boland has the details:The Vampire’s Wife, the fashion store set up by Nick Cave’s wife, said it was ceasing trading with immediate effect, despite “a period of positive growth and sales”.In a statement to customers, the company said: “The upheaval in the wholesale market has had dramatic implications for the brand.”It said it had sadly decided to close the business down.It comes weeks after it emerged that The Vampire’s Wife was among the brands set to lose out from the collapse of luxury fashion store MatchesFashion.According to administration documents, The Vampire’s Wife was owed £32,205 by MatchesFashion when owner Frasers placed it into administration.In total. MatchesFashion owed 541 unsecured creditors - including landlords, its suppliers and customers - a total of £35.9m.Two former financial market traders convicted of interest rate benchmark manipulation have lost their first bid to challenge their convictions at the Supreme Court.Tom Hayes, 44, a former Citigroup and UBS trader, was found guilty of multiple counts of conspiracy to defraud over manipulating the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (Libor) between 2006 and 2010.His case, alongside that of another similarly jailed trader, Carlo Palombo, 45, was referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice.In a ruling in March, three judges dismissed the appeals, with Lord Justice Bean finding that jurors were not misdirected in Hayes’ caseAnd at a short hearing on Tuesday, the same judge, sitting with Lord Justice Popplewell and Mr Justice Bryan, refused the pair permission to appeal at the Supreme Court.However, the three judges did rule the case involves a “point of law of general public importance”, keeping open the possibility of a challenge at the UK’s highest court.Lord Justice Bean said: “It should be for the Supreme Court to decide whether the point of law is one which it ought to consider in the light of the consistent series of decisions of the Court of Appeal.”Following the announcement, Hayes said: “I’m delighted that, at the fifth attempt the court has finally and correctly certified this as a point of law of public importance.”The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the benchmark S&P 500 opened lower amid policy caution from Federal Reserve officials ahead of the central bank’s meeting minutes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at the open to 39,804.40, while the S&P 500 opened lower by 9.44 points, or 0.2pc, at 5,298.69.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 58.78 points, or 0.4pc, to 16,736.10 at the opening bell as investors awaited AI chip leader Nvidia’s earnings this week.Online car retailer Cazoo said it has appointed administrators, putting more than 200 jobs at risk.The online used car business, which was founded by former Zoopla boss Alex Chesterman, has appointed insolvency practitioners at Teneo.It has been issued with a non-compliance notice on the New York Stock Exchange for failing to file its annual accounts.It comes less than two weeks after the company filed notice to appoint administrators, giving it temporary protection from creditors.Matt Mawhinney, joint administrator at Teneo, said:Following Cazoo’s decision to pivot to a marketplace model, the group has been winding down its legacy operations and sold a substantial number of its businesses and assets.These sales have generated additional value for creditors, preserved a significant number of jobs, and ensured that leases have been transferred to new operators to mitigate losses to landlords.Following our appointment, we continue to progress discussions with a number of interested parties on the marketplace business and remaining customer collections centres.The marketplace model is performing ahead of expectations, with strong dealer sign-up, and the administration appointment provides us with an opportunity to secure a sale of the business over the course of coming weeks.An activist investor in THG has demanded the removal of its chairman, Lord Charles Allen, as it continues pushing for a shake-up of the Manchester-based retail group.Shareholder Kelso said that it will vote against Lord Allen’s reinstatement at its upcoming meeting, criticising a “lack of action and clarity” from bosses on how they will boost THG’s share price.Lord Allen, the former boss of ITV, was named chairman in 2022 with the task of overhauling THG’s structure.It came amid concerns that chief executive Matthew Moulding had too much control over the business.Since then, Mr Moulding has given up his contentious so-called golden share which allowed him to block any attempt to take over the company, along with several other corporate governance initiatives.But THG has also endured a difficult trading period, having slashed 2,500 jobs since early 2022 and losing £252m last year. That was an improvement on a £549m loss the year before.Shares were trading at 75p on Tuesday, which is about 90pc down on their value when the company listed in London in September 2020.Upper Crust owner SSP Group has said it is set for a “summer of strong demand” as it expects the Paris Olympics and Euro 2024 football championships to boost travel across Europe.SSP - which runs food outlets at transport sites including airports and railway stations - saw revenues jump by nearly a fifth, up 19pc on a constant currency basis at £1.5bn in the six months to March 31.It said revenues were up 14pc in the first six weeks of the second half, including a 9pc rise in the UK.Underlying earnings lifted 24pc on a constant currency basis to £106m in the group’s first half, largely in line with analyst expectations.But SSP’s shares dropped 6.1pc as statutory pre-tax profits fell by 19pc to £13m and it stuck to its full year guidance of like-for-like sales growth of between 6pc and 10pc.Patrick Coveney, chief executive of SSP Group, said:Trading momentum has continued into the second half, and we are confident in delivering on our expectations for the full year.In particular, we are well set to capitalise on what we anticipate will be a summer of strong demand in all our markets - including continental Europe, where the Olympics and the European Championships will help boost footfall in airports and stations.A London theatre has suffered a backlash after seeking a chief executive from the “criminal class and/or underclass” in a job advert.Our employment editor Lucy Burton has the details:The Camden People’s Theatre, which received £250,000 of taxpayer funding from Arts Council England during the Covid crisis, has attracted anger and mockery on social media over the wording of its job posting for an artistic director and joint chief executive.The theatre, a charity, says in its advert that it encourages applications from individuals without formal education or who identify as “working-class, benefit class, criminal class and/or underclass”.Social media users hit back at the advert, writing on X (formerly Twitter) that the wording was insulting and using “Victorian” terms associated with class.See what you think of the advert.Wine seller Naked Wines has said it has started to see signs that its financial situation is improving, after a tough year which saw the retailer cut its workforce as it faced tumbling sales.The under-pressure business said total revenues were about £290m over the year to April, down 13pc from the previous year.But the company said this showed things were starting to improve since reporting an 18pc drop in sales over the first half of the year, after a 41pc decline in new sales.Chief executive Rodrigo Maza said it was making progress toward becoming a “leaner and stronger business”.The website works by connecting winemakers directly with buyers, who commit to paying a fixed amount each month which goes towards their next wine box purchase.Naked Wines, which said it had about 792,000 customers in the US, UK and Australia in the latest year, said it was expecting to report an operating loss of between £13m and £18m for the year.Shares in the business jumped by more than 10pc.Shell’s chairman was accused of greenwashing as he addressed shareholders at the oil giant’s annual general meeting (AGM).Sir Andrew MacKenzie was interrupted by protesters as he opened the gathering at the InterContinental London - The O2 hotel.Dozens of people stood up and began performing a rendition of the Dolly Parton song Jolene, singing “Shell kills, Shell kills, Shell kills, Shell kills”.As security staff carried protesters out of the meeting room, they chanted: “Who kills the climate? Shell kills the climate.”Four people could be seen shouting and linking arms to make it harder for security to remove them.Before the meeting, a crowd of demonstrators gathered outside the hotel, erecting large signs reading: “Shell profits kill” and “Your greed is killing humanity” as a protester made speeches through a megaphone.Sir Andrew began his opening remarks by defending the company’s stance on climate, emphasising the goal to be net zero by 2050 and how Shell believes the energy system will transition.It comes after Shell scaled back its short-term and medium-term targets, weakening a 2030 carbon reduction target and ditching a plan to reduce oil production by 1pc-2pc each year for the rest of the decade.Looking across the Pond, Wall Street has been muted in premarket trading as investors keep their powder dry before Nvidia publishes its latest results.Nvidia’s quarterly earnings on Wednesday are expected to be a significant market trigger and a litmus test for the success of the boom in generative AI.Traders are also being cautious after the latest comments from Federal Reserve officials ahead of the central bank’s meeting minutes.Rate setters have offered few clues on the timing for rate cuts this year and several Fed officials on Monday remained coy on the implications of recent falls in inflation.Technology stocks kicked off the week on a strong note, driving the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its highest closing level on Monday while the S&P 500 inched closer to its all-time high hit last week.In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all roughly flat.If Jeremy Hunt was angered at the IMF’s suggestion that the UK must fund £30bn of tax rises, he did not show it.The Chancellor was all smiles for the press conference with IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva and focused on her suggestion that Britain is on track for a “soft landing” from its period of high interest rates.He said:Today’s report clearly shows that independent international economists agree that the UK economy has turned a corner and is on course for a soft landing.The IMF have upgraded our growth for this year and forecast we will grow faster than any other large European country over the next six years - so it is time to shake off some of the unjustified pessimism about our prospects.Delighted to welcome @KGeorgieva and the IMF to London today for their annual health check on the UK economy.They're upgraded our growth forecasts and said the UK is approaching a soft landing from global economic difficulties - showing the UK economy really is turning a… pic.twitter.com/TC1MuTiMgi— Jeremy Hunt (@Jeremy_Hunt) May 21, 2024Britain is at risk of protests if the next government fails to improve living standards, the head of the IMF has warned.Our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has this latest update:Kristalina Georgieva said Britain needs more growth and productivity, and warned that protests may follow if the next government fails.She said: “If not, it is much more difficult to see standards of living improving.“If they do not, what do people do? They are on the streets.”Governments around the world must be careful not to borrow too much and exercise “fiscal prudence” following the global shocks that sent inflation surging, the head of the IMF has said.Kristalina Georgieva told a press conference in London:In a world of more uncertainty, we don’t know when there may be a call on governments to borrow more, to spend more.We had a prolonged period of very low interest rates. What happened in this period? They borrowed. They accumulated debt with low rate, very bearable, until it wasn’t.So then we were hit with two consecutive shocks, interest rates jumped and that reminded us that we have to put extra attention to fiscal prudence.She added: “We just don’t know where the next big shock may make from…so making sure that the fiscal position continues to strengthen so that economic challenges [can be addressed] flexibly when when it comes to choices that need to be made.”IMF boss Kristalina Georgieva said that higher growth is critical for keeping debt down, as the organisation increased its prediction for UK growth.Szu Ping Chan and Tim Wallace have the latest from her press conference in London:Ms Georgieva said making housing more affordable is also vital, as well as making sure young people have skills for the future.She said: “Long term illness and an ageing population are starting to weight on labour supply.”She added that she welcomes the long term plan for the NHS that implies one in 11 workers will be employed by the NHS in ten years time.However, she thinks the actions of the UK authorities, combined with favourable energy developments, are paying off, putting a soft landing “in sight”.She said: “The UK has done quite a lot to bring fiscal discipline to a point that we can project it will continue to be in low-risk territory in any scenario.”Kristalina Georgieva opened her press conference by saying a “soft landing is in sight” for the UK economy.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan is in the room at the Treasury:Ms Georgieva said the first quarter GDP “surprise” of 0.6pc, which was much higher than analysts had expected, “allows us to upgrade our growth forecast for this year…to 0.7pc”.She said: “Today, with inflation declining, real incomes are recovering. We retain our expectations for growth in 2025 to strengthen to 1.5pc.”Inflation is reaching an “inflexion point,” Ms Georgieva said, adding that the next step for the Bank of England is to “ease”.While she says a “meeting by meeting approach” is warranted, the IMF recommends up to three rate cuts this year.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said Britain has been through a “challenging time” as he opened a press conference with IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva.He told journalists at the Treasury:The only thing I really want to say before I hand over to the managing director is that the UK believes that we have global responsibilities at very challenging times.Whether it is leading up to our commitments on climate change, whether it is living up to our responsibilities with our aid budgets, whether it is making a key contribution to global security - and for that we believe that a strong IMF is very important for the world, because it is one of the few international organisations that brings together countries with very different value systems.He added:We have been through a challenging time in the last couple of years. As you all know, when I arrived was Chancellor the Bank of England the longest recession in 100 years and we’ve taken a lot of very difficult decisions.So we are very interested to hear what the IMF says in terms of process we’ve been through and our big priority is not just stabilisation, but also growth and increase our long term growth rate.The next government will have to find £30bn of tax rises or spending cuts to get debt down as the economy struggles with a post-lockdown surge in worklessness, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned.Our economics editor Szu Ping Chan has the latest:The Fund said Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer both faced “tough choices” if they win the next election, warning the Prime Minister against further tax cuts in the short-term despite an improved economic outlook.The IMF upgraded its UK growth forecast this year from 0.5pc to 0.7pc as it called time on an era of high inflation.It also backed the government’s plans to “contain” Britain’s soaring welfare bill, adding that those “capable of work” should be “incentivised to do so”.Read why the the IMF said spending pressures from an ageing population and weak productivity growth were being exacerbated by the worst sickness crisis on record.The IMF has urged ministers to raid inheritances and charge drivers for using the roads in a bid to find the cash to increase spending, even as drivers buy electric cars and so stop paying tax on petrol and diesel.Our deputy economics editor Tim Wallace has the details:Jeremy Hunt has not budgeted enough money for health, social care or net zero, the global financial watchdog has warned.But the national debt is also rising, so extra spending has to be funded by tax rises instead of more borrowing, it said.The Chancellor’s plans “do not appear to sufficiently account for known pressures in public services (especially health and social care), and critical growth-enhancing investment needs (including for the green transition),” the IMF said in its review of Britain’s economy and finances.Raising taxes by another 1pc of GDP would help raise spending while stabilising debt, it said.“This could be achieved, for example, by raising additional revenue from higher carbon and road-usage taxation, broadening the VAT and inheritance tax bases, and reforming capital gains and property taxation (which could also allow a reduction in stamp duty),” the IMF said.Road-usage taxation indicates fuel duty, which is fading as drivers go electric, could be replaced by road pricing - which could mean a system of monitoring drivers’ journeys to charge them based on the distance they travel, and potentially increasing costs for those who drive at peak times.Asda has been hit by a fresh slump in sales as the heavily indebted supermarket chain struggles to boost demand in stores.Our retail editor Hannah Boland has the details:Shoppers have cut their spending at Asda in recent weeks, with sales down by 2pc in the 12 weeks to May 12, new Kantar figures show. It follows a 0.4pc decline in the prior 12-week period.The figures also revealed that overall food price inflation has fallen to its lowest level since October 2021, in a further sign prices are coming under control as the Bank of England seeks to cut interest rates.The decline at Asda makes it the worst performing supermarket and means the gap with larger rivals Tesco and Sainsbury’s has widened.Asda holds a 13.1pc share of the grocery market compared to 13.9pc a year earlier. It had a 14.8pc share in early 2021.Read how the figures will add to growing concerns around the pressures on Asda.Sixteen companies involved in AI - including Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI - have committed to safe development of the technology.The announcement unveiled the Government came as South Korea and Britain host a global AI summit in Seoul.The agreement, which also includes companies from China, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates - is a step up from the number of commitments at the first global AI summit held six months ago, ministers said.Zhipu.ai, backed by Chinese tech giants Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan and Xiaomi, as well as UAE’s Technology Innovation Institute were among the 16 companies pledging to publish safety frameworks on how they will measure risks of frontier AI models.The fcompaniess, also including Amazon, IBM and Samsung Electronics, voluntarily committed to not develop or deploy AI models if the risks cannot be sufficiently mitigated, and to ensure governance and transparency on approaches to AI safety, the statement said.Beth Barnes, founder at METR, a non-profit for AI model safety, said: “It’s vital to get international agreement on the ‘red lines’ where AI development would become unacceptably dangerous to public safety.”The US Treasury Secretary has urged the European Union to join its efforts to clampdown on cheap Chinese exports which she believes could put Western businesses at risk.Janet Yellen said t the United States and Europe need to respond to China’s industrial policies in a “strategic and united way” to keep manufacturers viable on both sides of the Atlantic.Speaking in Frankfurt, she said China’s excess industrial capacity threatens both American and European companies as well as the industrial development of emerging market countries.It comes a week after Joe Biden’s administration imposed tariffs on $18bn of Chinese goods, with the White House accusing Beijing of “flooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports”.Ms Yellen said: “China’s industrial policy may seem remote as we sit here in this room, but if we do not respond strategically and in a united way, the viability of businesses in both our countries and around the world could be at risk.”Donald Trump’s social network lost $327.6m (£257.7m) in the first three months of the year, according to the first results released since its blockbuster $8bn float in March.Our technology editor James Titcomb has the details:Trump Media and Technology (TMTG), the parent company of Mr Trump’s Twitter rival Truth Social, suffered the loss on revenues of just $770,500, a drop from $1.1m a year earlier. It attributed the fall to “a change in the revenue share with one of our advertising partners”.The losses were almost entirely driven by accounting expenses related to the company recently going public in New York.On an operating basis, the company lost $12.1m, around half of which were costs associated with the float.The company is currently valued at $6.6bn and makes up a significant portion of the former president’s wealth. He owns a 65pc stake in TMTG.Read why commentators have said that the company’s value is detached from financial reality.The online car supermarket Cazoo is expected to fall into administration today after failing to secure emergency funding.The digital used car business, founded by former Zoopla boss Alex Chesterman, will appoint insolvency practitioners from Teneo as administrators a week after it filed a notice at the High Court, according to Sky News.It marks a dramatic fall from grace for the British car dealer, which was valued at over $8bn (£6.4bn) after floating on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021.Artificial intelligence could be fundamentally disruptive but help boost productivity in Britain’s economy, a Bank of England policymaker has said.Randall Kroszner, a member of the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee, said AI may be the answer to solving the UK’s productivity problem, which is “crucial to boosting real wage growth and sustaining economic growth, particularly when the number of hours worked in an economy may be declining as populations are ageing and growing more slowly”.However, he acknowledged that AI poses a challenge to regulators. He said:The challenge is therefore to develop a regulatory framework that fosters the flowering of creativity and innovation but takes into account the potential financial stability risks.Regulators, however, should be open to new approaches that might shape these frameworks.GSK has revealed that an experimental drug reduced asthma attacks in late-stage trials, paving the way for a treatment which it thinks could lead to £3bn in sales.Named depemokimab, the drug provided “clinically meaningful reductions” in the number of flare ups experienced by sufferers during a year-long trial.The drug could become the first approved “ultra-long-acting” treatment of its type, with a single dose lasting six months.However, GSK’s share price was down 1.5pc in early trading, having risen more than 18pc so far this year.The pound was within striking distance of its two-month high versus the dollar but was set to break a seven-day winning streak against the euro ahead of key economic data.Sterling rose 0.1pc to $1.272, a day after hitting $1.273 the day before, its highest level since March 21.Closely-watched consumer price inflation data is due on Wednesday and “flash” PMI data on British business activity will follow the next day.The pound has been supported by increasing bets that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice this year - and it has strengthened recently against the euro amid bets that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates in June.The pound dropped 0.1pc at €85.44 per pound, after rising for seven sessions from around 86p on May 10.Paul Mackel, global head of forex research at HSBC, said:Since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, it has been well understood that the June rate cut scenario depends on this week’s CPI and the next one due June 19.We maintain GBP-USD is expensive versus what interest differentials imply.Some of the world’s leading AI scientists have called for stronger action on AI risk from world leaders, as a summit in South Korea gets underway six months after the first meeting of its kind in Britain.Rishi Sunak will co-host a virtual meeting of world leaders with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol today to open the summit, where he will say that managing the risks posed by artificial intelligence is “one of the most profound responsibilities” faced by governments.However, in a new expert consensus paper published in the journal Science, 25 of the world’s leading scientists in the technology say governments are moving too slowly to regulate the rapidly evolving technology and there has not been enough progress since the previous summit.They argue that world leaders must take seriously the possibility that more powerful general use AI systems - which are capable of regularly outperforming humans - will be developed in the current decade or next, and respond accordingly.Professor Philip Torr from Oxford university, who co-authored the paper, said:The world agreed during the last AI summit that we needed action, but now it is time to go from vague proposals to concrete commitments.This paper provides many important recommendations for what companies and governments should commit to do.UK stocks opened lower as US Federal Reserve officials maintained a cautious stance on inflation.The blue-chip FTSE 100 was down 0.3pc and set for its worst day in over a month. The mid-cap FTSE 250 dropped 0.4pc.Investors have turned wary as Fed officials hesitated to declare that inflation is on track to meet the central bank’s target on Monday.Traders also held back from placing big bets as they awaited a speech from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey this evening, and UK inflation data on Wednesday.Global stocks are also likely to be impacted by chipmaker Nvidia’s quarterly results given the euphoria around artificial intelligence.AstraZeneca gained 1.2pc after the pharmaceuticals giant said it expects to deliver $80bn (£62.9bn) in total revenue by 2030.Dowlais Group fell 5.9pc after the GKN automotive owner warned of lower revenue in 2024.B&Q and Screwfix owner Kingfisher has said UK sales edged up in recent months, but cautioned over weaker spending on so-called big ticket items and the knock-on impact of slower housing demand.The DIY giant reported a 2.7pc rise in sales in the UK and Ireland at constant currency to £1.6bn over the three months to the end of April, compared with the same period last year.This was driven by improved consumer spending on tools, hardware and building and joinery products, particularly for Screwfix, which is set to open up to 40 stores across the region during the financial year.However, sales of its “big ticket” purchases fell by more than 6pc across the group as consumer confidence remained under pressure.The category includes includes bigger spending projects like kitchen and bathroom sales, and makes up about 15pc of its total sales.The retail group also said it was remaining cautious about the lag between housing demand and home improvements.Shares fell by 0.9pc in early trading.UK stocks slumped as trading began ahead of inflation data this week which is expected to be crucial in the Bank of England’s decision making on cutting interest rates.The FTSE 100 has fallen 0.4pc to 8,390.42 while the midcap FTSE 250 has dropped by 0.4pc to 20,797.88.Grocery price inflation has slowed to its lowest level since October 2021 in a boost to hopes that the Bank of England will begin cutting interest rates this summer.Supermarket prices are 2.4pc higher than a year ago, slowing for the 15th month in a row from April’s 3.2pc, according to analysts Kantar.Grocery inflation is now just 0.8 percentage points above the 10-year average of 1.6pc between 2012 and 2021, just before prices began to climb.It comes after Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent said summer rate cuts are “possible” amid falling inflation, with money markets placing a 53pc chance of a first reduction in June.Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said:Grocery price inflation is gradually returning to what we would consider more normal levels.Typically, an inflation rate of around 3pc is when we start to see marked changes in consumers’ behaviour, with shoppers trading down to cheaper items when the rate goes above this line and vice versa when the rate drops.However, after nearly two-and-a-half years of rapidly rising prices, it could take a bit longer for shoppers to unwind the habits they have learnt to help them manage the cost of living crisis.International investors are avoiding German property deals as the market suffers its worst crisis in a generation.Foreign buyers accounted for 35pc of purchases of commercial real estate in the first quarter, data from BNP Paribas Real Estate shows.That is less than in any year since 2013 and comes against the backdrop of a 70pc plunge in sales volumes from levels before the 2020-2021 pandemic.The grim figures coincide with a debate about whether Germany is once again “the sick man of Europe” - a label it was given in late 1990s as it struggled with economic stagnation and high unemployment.The nation worked years to shake that label off, but it has re-emerged as Germany weans itself off Russian energy, gets tangled in bureaucracy and sees far-right politicians gaining in the polls.Kurt Zech, one of Germany’s biggest developers, warns the market will keep struggling until foreign investors return.He said: “The Americans have to come back. When the Blackstones, the Blackrocks, the Morgan Stanley’s of this world and Carlyle and Apollo buy in the German market, that will be noticed and then we will all know that we have now reached the bottom.”AstraZeneca said it expects to deliver $80bn (£62.9bn) in total revenue by 2030 as it is poised to launch 20 new medicines.The Anglo-Swedish drugs makers aid it would also be boosted by growth in its existing oncology, biopharmaceuticals and rare disease portfolio.The company said in a statement it would continue to invest in new technologies and platforms that will “shape the future of medicine” beyond 2030.The owner of South West Water has cut its dividend by £2.4m after it was handed a record fine for illegally dumping sewage into rivers and the sea.Pennon Water said the decision to reduce its total payout to investors by 0.84p a share to 44.37p showed “we are listening, clearing the way for long-term shareholder value”.The business was fined £2.2m in April last year for illegally dumping sewage into rivers and the sea in Devon and Cornwall, following an investigation by the Environment Agency that found South West Water culpable for significant environmental harm.The dividend, which is worth a total of £126.9m, comes as about 17,000 households were affected by a boil water notice after traces of the parasite were discovered in the company’s water network in Brixham, Devon.The utility company, which also owns Bristol Water, said revenues increased by 10pc to £907.8m while pre-tax losses deepened from £8.5m to £9.1m.Chief executive Susan Davy said: “Whilst the results we are announcing today are based on our performance for the last financial year, we are 100pc focused on returning a safe water supply to the people and businesses in and around Brixham.“Normal service has returned for 85pc of customers, but we won’t stop until the local drinking water is returned to the quality all our customers expect and deserve.“Our absolute priority continues to be the health and safety of our customers and our operational teams are working tirelessly around the clock to deliver this.”Pennon revealed it is paying out about £3.5m in compensation to customers affected by the parasite outbreak in Devon amid calls for the company to offer more for impacted households and businesses.The company upped compensation to £215 for customers in recent days as many were still subjected to boil water advice in Brixham.Conservative MP Anthony Mangnall, whose Totnes constituency covers Brixham, has said customers should get a level of compensation they “deserve” following the outbreak.According to the Government, 16,000 households and businesses in Brixham, supplied by SWW, were initially told not to use their tap water for drinking without boiling and cooling it first while two people have been taken to hospital as a result of the outbreak.Pennon Group revealed that it suffered more pollution incidents last year, which it blamed on exceptional rainfall.South West Water recorded an average of 43.3 spills per asset, compared with 28.5 in 2022.Thanks for joining me. We begin with the latest annual results from the owner of South West Water, the utility company hit by a parasite outbreak in Devon earlier this month.Pennon Water announced it has decided to cut its dividend to shareholders by £2.4m - the equivalent of a court fine it was issued last year for illegally dumping sewage into rivers and the sea in Devon and Cornwall.1) Founder Sir Charles Dunstone prepares to bail out TalkTalk | Shadow foreign secretary urges Government to recognise jurisdiction of international court2) Britain cannot afford to turn its back on Chinese money, warns City minister | Warning reveals deepening split among Conservatives over ties with Beijing3) Ukraine power company appeals for British help after Russia wipes out coal plants | Kyiv’s DTEK appeals for equipment as Putin destroys 90pc of coal-generation capacity4) Canary Wharf hit by winding up petition in row over energy bill | NPower files case over debt owed by retailer that closed in 20235) Bank of England on course for summer rate cut, suggests deputy governor | Ben Broadbent opens the door to lower borrowing costs if inflation falls as expectedAsian shares mostly fell Tuesday, even as most U.S. stock indexes finished higher, especially technology issues like Nvidia.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 0.2pc to 39,141.08.
