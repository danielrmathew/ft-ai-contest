The fund also raised its stakes in PDD Holdings and Baidu Inc., while adding JD.com and two Chinese exchange-traded funds as new buys during the quarter.As Tepper built up positions in Chinese stocks, he trimmed holdings in so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, including Amazon.com, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp. The result: Chinese shares and ETFs accounted for 24% of the fund’s equity portfolio as of the end of the quarter.Tepper is among global investors who are cautiously returning to Chinese stocks after a meltdown earlier this year sent their valuations to a record discount relative to their US peers. As a group, hedge funds lifted their holdings in Alibaba, PDD and Baidu during the quarter, while scaling back on companies including JD.com and two electronic vehicle makers — Nio Inc. and Li Auto, according to the quarterly filing data.Their purchases were well-timed.
