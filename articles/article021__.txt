Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owned Google said it will invest an additional 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to expand its data center campus in Finland.This investment aims to bolster its artificial intelligence (AI) business in Europe, and underscores Google’s commitment to enhancing its technological infrastructure and AI capabilities in the region.Data centers have increasingly found homes in the Nordic countries, benefiting from the region's cooler climate, tax incentives, and ample renewable energy resources, reported Reuters.However, neighboring countries like Sweden and Norway have started to voice concerns about hosting these energy-intensive facilities.Industry experts suggest that these nations should prioritize renewable energy for high-value products like green steel.Finland, in contrast, has seen a rapid expansion of its wind power capacity, growing by 75% to 5,677 megawatts in 2022.This growth has occasionally led to negative electricity prices on windy days, indicating an excess of renewable energy.Google’s long-term contracts for wind power in Finland ensure a stable supply for its data centers, aligning with the country's renewable energy capabilities.Related Read: Google Seeks To Repeat Chromebook Success In Education By Rolling Out ‘Gemini’ AI For Schools, Promises Enhanced Data PrivacyAnalysts predict a significant rise in power consumption due to the surge in AI applications.
