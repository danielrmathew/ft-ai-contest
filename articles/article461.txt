Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares are trading higher on Tuesday. The EV behemoth, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, reportedly faces escalated tensions as Sweden’s most prominent union backs a six-month-old strike by mechanics, amplifying disputes with organized labor, Reuters reported.The strike centers on Musk’s refusal to sign a collective bargaining agreement, preventing the metal workers’ union from negotiating for the entire workforce.Despite Musk’s claim that the labor conflict had subsided, IF Metall maintains the strike persists, the report added.“The strike is ongoing and we have no signs of reaching an agreement in the near future,” IF Metall head Marie Nilsson said.“We have had a few sittings with the Swedish management during April, but ... Tesla has shown little willingness in discussing an end to the conflict,” Reuters added.According to Reuters, approximately 44 union members, representing roughly one-third of Tesla’s Swedish mechanics, have ceased work. Although Tesla does not manufacture vehicles in Sweden, it provides local servicing.Over a dozen unions have initiated actions in solidarity with IF Metall, with Unionen being the most recent and largest addition to the movement, the report added.“It is fundamentally important to protect our collective agreement system,” Martin Wastfeldt, head of negotiations at Unionen, told Reuters.Unionen initiated a blockade on Tuesday, halting all Tesla-related work at DEKRA Industrial AB, responsible for equipment inspections, according to Reuters.Should Tesla attempt to bypass the blockade by engaging alternative providers, Unionen is prepared to take further action, according to Wastfeldt, Reuters added.Though the striking figures in Sweden may be modest, the implications loom large, the report stated.While Elon Musk did not respond to the Reuters report directly, he poked fun at the company by posting a meme on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).pic.twitter.com/zTCVL0NiMq— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2024Price Action: TSLA shares are trading higher by 3.39% to $177.80 at last check Tuesday.Read Next: Biden Chief Economic Advisor Promises Relief For Middle Class, Sets Sights On Overturning Corporate Tax Cuts: ReportDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo via Shutterstock"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 "news & everything else" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Tesla Versus Swedish Union Sparks Showdown Over Collective Bargaining originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.
