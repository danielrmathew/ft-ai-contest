Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is contesting a $1.95 billion (1.8 billion euros) fine imposed by the European Union, which accuses the tech giant of undermining fair competition from music-streaming services like Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT).The company has filed an appeal with the EU's General Court in Luxembourg to overturn the decision made in March, according to a report from Bloomberg.The EU's action against Apple also includes a mandate to stop preventing music-streaming apps from informing users about cheaper deals outside of its App Store.Spotify has been changing its app, such as displaying pricing information in-app for EU users, to comply with the European Commission's antitrust ruling against Apple.The investigation began following a complaint from Spotify, which claimed that Apple's control over the App Store forced it to raise subscription prices to cover additional costs.The European Commission, the EU's antitrust authority, has stated it is prepared to defend its decision in court.Related Read: TikTok Parent ByteDance Overtakes Baidu In AI Chatbot Race In China: ReportHowever, Apple pointed to an earlier blog post that argued that EU regulators did not find any credible evidence of consumer harm.This latest appeal is part of a series of legal battles between Apple and EU regulators.
